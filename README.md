# Tools written with Golang

**dbhelper**

The folder contain files to generate tables on database, generate sql statements for developer, and generate go struct for programer.


**net**
The folder contain tools related with network.

*localip*
When work on Mac, sometimes I want to get local ip address, and I will use ifconfig command, and find local ip.

After build this tool, I can just run `localip`, and I will get the ip address, it's really helpful.
